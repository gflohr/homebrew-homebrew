# My Homebrew Formulae

This is a tap for [homebrew](https://brew.sh) with formulae for software that
I have written, like, or need.

## Installation

Well, you don't really install a tap. But you can add it to the repositories
to be searched like this:

```sh
$ brew tap gflohr/homebrew
```

## Uninstall

If you are too lazy researching how to get rid of a tap, here you are for
this particular tap:

```sh
$ brew untap gflohr/homebrew
```

## Available for Adoption?

Sure! All formulae are.  If you want to transfer a formula into the official
[homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) tap, go ahead and
do so.  If you are nice, you will
[file an issue here](https://github.com/gflohr/homebrew-homebrew/issues/new/choose),
so that I can remove the formula from this repository.

## Available Formulae

### Qgoda

[Qgoda](https://www.qgoda.net) is the multi-lingual static site generator.
You can install it with:

```sh
$ brew tap gflohr/homebrew
$ brew install qgoda
```

## Why the Funny Name

Yes, "homebrew-homebrew" is a little wonky as a name.  But I wanted people
to be able use it as `brew tap gflohr/homebrew` and that is what it has to
be named for this purpose.
