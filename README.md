# My Homebrew Formulae

This is a tap for [homebrew](https://brew.sh) with formulae for software that
I have written or like.

## Installation

Well, you don't really install a tap. But you can add it to the repositories
to be searched like this:

```sh
$ brew tap gflohr/homebrew
```

## Uninstall

If you are too lazy researching how to get rid of a tap, here you are for
this particular tap:

```sh
$ brew untap gflohr/homebrew
```

## Available Formulae

### Qgoda

[Qgoda](https://www.qgoda.net) is the multi-lingual static site generator.
You can install it with:

```sh
$ brew tap gflohr/homebrew
$ brew install qgoda
```

## Why the Funny Name

Yes, "homebrew-homebrew" is a little wonky as a name.  But I wanted people
to be able use it as `brew tap gflohr/homebrew` and that is what it has to
be named for this purpose.
